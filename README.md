# FILEPATH: diamond_price_prediction.py

"""
This script is part of a machine learning project that predicts the price of diamonds based on a given dataset. 
The dataset is used to train a model that can then be used to make predictions on new data. 

To use this script, you will need to have the necessary dependencies installed, such as scikit-learn and pandas. 
You will also need to have the diamond dataset in the correct format. 

Once you have everything set up, you can run this script to train the model and make predictions on new data. 
The resulting predictions can be used to inform pricing decisions for diamonds.

For more information on how to use this script and the machine learning model it trains, please refer to the README.md file.
